# Security Guide

Security is a top priority for **[Your Project Name]**. This guide outlines security best practices for users and provides instructions for responsibly reporting vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability ðŸ”’

If you discover a security vulnerability, we ask that you follow our responsible disclosure policy by **not** making it public immediately.

1.  **Do NOT** open a public GitHub Issue.
2.  **Email Us:** Send a detailed report directly to the core development team at **security@[yourdomain.com]** (or another private channel).
3.  **Include Details:** The report should include:
    * A description of the vulnerability.
    * Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    * The affected versions of the project.
    * Your suggested remediation (if known).

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and work with you to fix the issue promptly.

## User Best Practices

### 1. API Keys and Secrets

* **Never** commit API keys, database passwords, or other secrets to your version control system (Git).
* Use **[Environment Variables](../getting-started/configuration.md)** for all sensitive information.
* Rotate your API keys regularly, especially if you suspect one has been compromised.

### 2. Dependency Management

* Run automated dependency checks regularly (e.g., Dependabot or Snyk) to ensure all third-party libraries are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities.
* Only use dependencies that are actively maintained.

### 3. User Input

* If you are extending the project to handle user input, always assume input is malicious.
* Ensure all user-provided data is properly **sanitized and validated** before being processed or saved to a database.
