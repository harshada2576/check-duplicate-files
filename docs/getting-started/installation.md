# Installation

This guide walks you through installing **[Your Project Name]**.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* **[Dependency 1]**: Version [X.Y] or higher (e.g., Node.js: Version 16+)
* **[Dependency 2]**: (e.g., Python: Version 3.8+)

## 1. Standard Installation (Recommended)

The easiest way to install the project is via **[Package Manager]** (e.g., npm, pip, composer).

### Command

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Example for a Python project:
pip install your-project-name

# Example for a Node.js project:
npm install your-project-name
2. Installing from Source
If you want to contribute or need the very latest version, you can install directly from the source code.

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone [Link to your repo]
cd your-project-name
Install dependencies and build:

Bash

# Example commands, adjust as needed
pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
npm install
npm run build
Next Steps
Once installed, proceed to the Configuration Guide.
