# Configuration

After successfully **[installing the project](./installation.md)**, you'll likely need to configure it for your specific environment or use case.

## Default Configuration

By default, **[Your Project Name]** runs with the following settings:

* **Host**: `127.0.0.1` (localhost)
* **Port**: `8080`
* **Log Level**: `INFO`

## Configuration Methods

There are two primary ways to configure the project: using environment variables or a dedicated configuration file.

### A. Using Environment Variables (Recommended for Production)

You can override default settings by setting environment variables prefixed with `PROJECT_`.

| Variable | Description | Example Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PROJECT_PORT` | The network port the service will bind to. | `80` |
| `PROJECT_LOG_LEVEL` | The verbosity of logging. | `DEBUG`, `WARN`, `ERROR` |
| `PROJECT_DATABASE_URL` | Connection string for the database. | `postgres://user:pass@host:5432/db` |

**Example (Linux/macOS):**
```bash
export PROJECT_PORT=80
your-project-name run
B. Using a Configuration File
For complex setups, you can use a dedicated configuration file, typically named config.yaml or config.json. Place this file in your project's root directory.

config.yaml Example:

YAML

# config.yaml
server:
  port: 8080
  host: 0.0.0.0
logging:
  level: DEBUG
database:
  url: 'sqlite:///data.db'
To use a configuration file, pass its path when starting the application:

Bash

your-project-name --config-file ./config.yaml
Next Steps
With installation and configuration complete, you're ready to dive into [suspicious link removed] or start [suspicious link removed].
