### 1. Setup Your Environment

Make sure you have followed the **[Installation guide](../getting-started/installation.md)** to set up the development environment.

### 2. Fork and Clone

Create a descriptive branch for your changes (e.g., `feature/add-caching` or `fix/issue-42`).

4. Implement and Test
Make your code changes.

Write or update tests to cover your changes.

Run all tests to ensure nothing is broken:
