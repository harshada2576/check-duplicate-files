# Architecture

Understanding the project's architecture is key to contributing effectively and making informed decisions about development.

## High-Level Overview

**[Your Project Name]** follows a **[Pattern, e.g., Layered, Microservice, MVC]** architecture. Its core philosophy is **[e.g., separation of concerns, performance, extensibility]**.

At a high level, the system is composed of three main layers:

1.  **Presentation Layer:** Handles input/output (HTTP, CLI, GUI).
2.  **Business/Service Layer:** Contains the core logic and handles interactions between the presentation and data layers.
3.  **Data Layer:** Manages persistence (database, file system, external APIs).

## Codebase Structure

The primary directories in the source (`src/` or `app/`) folder are organized as follows:

| Directory | Purpose | Key Files/Modules |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `src/core/` | **Core Logic.** Contains reusable utilities and foundational classes. | `logger.py`, `errors.js`, `settings.go` |
| `src/services/` | **Business Logic.** Where the main application features reside. | `UserService.py`, `OrderProcessor.js` |
| `src/data/` | **Persistence Layer.** Database models, repositories, and ORM setup. | `models.py`, `database.go` |
| `src/api/` | **Presentation/Endpoints.** Defines the public interface (e.g., API routes). | `routes.py`, `handlers.js` |
| `tests/` | **Testing.** Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests. | `test_core.py`, `test_api.js` |

## Key Components

### 1. The Dispatcher

The **Dispatcher** (`src/core/dispatcher.py`) is responsible for routing incoming requests (from the Presentation Layer) to the correct **Service** in the Business Layer.

### 2. Service Interfaces

We use **Service Interfaces** (or abstract classes) heavily to ensure the Business Logic is decoupled from the underlying implementation. This allows us to swap out, for example, a PostgreSQL database for a MySQL database without changing the core business rules.

## Data Flow Example

1.  A user makes an **HTTP request** to `/api/v1/users/`.
2.  The **API Handler** (`src/api/routes.py`) receives the request.
3.  The Handler calls the `UserService.get_all_users()` method in the **Business Layer**.
4.  The `UserService` calls the `UserRepository.find_all()` method in the **Data Layer**.
5.  The `UserRepository` executes a query against the database and returns the result.
6.  The data flows back up to the **API Handler**, which serializes it and returns an HTTP response.
