# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide covers common, complex issues you might encounter while installing, running, or developing with **[Your Project Name]**.

## Problem 1: Database Connection Timeouts

### üîç Symptom
The application starts up but fails to connect to the database, throwing a `DatabaseTimeoutError` or `ConnectionRefusedError`.

### üõ†Ô∏è Common Causes & Solutions
1.  **Firewall Blocking Port:**
    * **Action:** Check that your local firewall (or the server's security group) is not blocking traffic on the database port (e.g., PostgreSQL default `5432`, MySQL default `3306`).
2.  **Incorrect Host/Port:**
    * **Action:** Double-check the `PROJECT_DATABASE_URL` environment variable or the configuration file settings to ensure the host IP and port are correct (see **[Configuration Guide](../getting-started/configuration.md)**).
3.  **Database Not Started:**
    * **Action:** Verify that the database service (e.g., Docker container, local service) is actually running and accessible.

## Problem 2: Build Fails Due to C/C++ Compiler Errors

### üîç Symptom
When installing dependencies (e.g., via `pip install` or `npm install`), the process stops with errors related to `gcc`, `cl.exe`, or missing header files.

### üõ†Ô∏è Common Causes & Solutions
Many packages rely on underlying C/C++ libraries that need to be compiled.
1.  **Missing Build Tools (Linux/macOS):**
    * **Action:** Install the necessary development packages. On Debian/Ubuntu, this is often `sudo apt install build-essential`. On macOS, ensure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed (`xcode-select --install`).
2.  **Missing Build Tools (Windows):**
    * **Action:** Install the appropriate version of the **Visual C++ Build Tools**. For Python, this often corresponds to the Python version you are using.

## Problem 3: Performance Degradation Over Time

### üîç Symptom
The application performs well initially but slows down significantly after several hours of use, often accompanied by high memory usage.

### üõ†Ô∏è Common Causes & Solutions
1.  **Memory Leak:**
    * **Action:** Use a memory profiler (e.g., `memprof` in Python, Chrome DevTools in Node.js) to investigate if any components are failing to release memory (e.g., uncached database results or unclosed file handles).
2.  **Unindexed Database Queries:**
    * **Action:** Review your database logs. Slow performance is frequently caused by database queries that are running full table scans. Add appropriate indexes to slow-running queries.
