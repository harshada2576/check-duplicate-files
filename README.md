# üïäÔ∏è Pigeon Finder - Advanced Duplicate File Detective

**Intelligent duplicate file detection using the mathematical Pigeonhole Principle for optimal performance**

Pigeon Finder is a sophisticated duplicate file detection tool that leverages the mathematical Pigeonhole Principle to dramatically reduce scan times while maintaining 100% accuracy. Unlike traditional duplicate finders that compare every file against every other file (O(n¬≤) complexity), Pigeon Finder groups files by size first, then only computes hashes for files in multi-file size groups.

- **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

## üéØ How the Pigeonhole Principle Works

The Pigeonhole Principle states that if n items are put into m containers with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item. In duplicate detection:

1. **Group by Size**: Files are first grouped by their size (the "pigeonholes")
2. **Eliminate Singles**: Files with unique sizes cannot have duplicates
3. **Hash Only Groups**: Compute hashes only for files in multi-file size groups
4. **Verify Duplicates**: Compare hashes within each size group

**Performance Impact**:
- **Naive Approach**: O(n¬≤) comparisons
- **Pigeon Finder**: O(k) comparisons (where k is the number of size groups with potential duplicates)
- **Typical Savings**: 70-90% fewer hash computations

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8 or higher** (Recommended: **Python 3.12** for best compatibility)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Git** (optional, for cloning the repository)

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### Option 1: Automated Setup (Recommended for Windows)

1. **Download the project**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pigeon-finder.git
   cd pigeon-finder
   ```

2. **Run the automated setup script**:
   ```powershell
   # Windows PowerShell
   .\quick_setup.ps1
   ```

   This script will:
   - Detect your Python version
   - Create a virtual environment
   - Install all dependencies
   - Verify the installation

#### Option 2: Manual Setup

1. **Create and activate virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   # Windows
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # macOS/Linux
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If you don't have `requirements.txt`, install manually:
   ```bash
   pip install customtkinter==5.2.2 Pillow==9.5.0 psutil==5.9.6 matplotlib==3.8.2 send2trash==1.8.2 watchdog==3.0.0 PTable==0.9.2
   ```

#### Option 3: Using Python 3.12 (Best Compatibility)

If you have multiple Python versions:

```bash
# Check available Python versions
py -0

# Create environment with Python 3.12
py -3.12 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üéÆ Usage

### Starting the Application

```bash
# Activate virtual environment (if not already active)
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

# Run the application
python run_pigeon_finder.py
```

### First Time Usage

1. **Launch the application** using the command above
2. **Select a directory** to scan (start with a small folder for testing)
3. **Configure scan options**:
   - File size filters (min/max)
   - File extensions to include
   - Hash algorithm (MD5 for speed, SHA256 for security)
4. **Click "Start Scan"** and watch the Pigeonhole Principle in action!

### Basic Workflow

1. **Directory Selection**: Choose the folder you want to scan for duplicates
2. **Scan Configuration**: Set filters and algorithm preferences
3. **Run Scan**: Watch real-time progress and efficiency metrics
4. **Review Results**: Browse duplicate groups in the Results tab
5. **Manage Files**: Select duplicates for deletion, moving, or other actions
6. **Analyze Statistics**: View detailed analytics in the Statistics tab

### Advanced Features

#### Batch Operations
- Select multiple files across different duplicate groups
- Delete, move, or create symlinks in batch
- Export results for later analysis

#### Real-time Monitoring
- Enable directory watching to automatically detect new duplicates
- Monitor system resources during operations
- Receive notifications for file system changes

#### File Preview
- Preview images and text files directly in the application
- Compare files side-by-side
- View detailed file information

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError" or Import Errors
**Solution**:
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
pip install --force-reinstall -r requirements.txt

# Or install individually
pip install customtkinter Pillow psutil matplotlib send2trash watchdog PTable
```

#### Issue: Python 3.13 Compatibility Problems
**Solution**: Use Python 3.12 instead:
```bash
# Install Python 3.12 from python.org, then:
py -3.12 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Issue: Application Won't Start
**Solution**: Check the virtual environment is activated:
```bash
# Verify activation (should show venv in prompt)
(venv) PS C:\path\to\pigeon-finder>

# If not activated:
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
```

#### Issue: Slow Performance
**Solutions**:
- Use MD5 instead of SHA256 for faster hashing
- Increase the chunk size in advanced settings
- Scan smaller directories first
- Close other resource-intensive applications

### Platform-Specific Notes

#### Windows
- No additional dependencies required
- Recycle bin integration for safe deletion
- Native file system monitoring

#### macOS
- May require `python3-tk` for some distributions
- Tested on macOS 10.14+

#### Linux
- Install Tkinter: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
- Tested on Ubuntu 18.04+, CentOS 7+

## üìä Performance Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with directories containing 1,000-10,000 files
2. **Use MD5**: For general use, MD5 provides the best speed/accuracy balance
3. **Set Size Filters**: Exclude very small or very large files if not needed
4. **Monitor Resources**: Use the built-in system monitor during large scans
5. **Batch Operations**: Use batch operations for managing large numbers of duplicates

## üîß Development

### Adding New Features

The project uses a modular architecture:

- **Core Logic**: `core_*.py` files contain business logic
- **UI Components**: `ui_*.py` files handle user interface
- **Styles**: Centralized styling in `ui_styles.py`

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run basic functionality tests
python final_test.py

# Test individual components
python -c "from core_file_scanner import FileScanner; print('FileScanner OK')"
```
