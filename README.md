# üê¶ PigeonFinder: The Efficient Duplicate File Finder

PigeonFinder is a fast, robust, and feature-rich Command Line Interface (CLI) utility designed to scan large directories and swiftly identify and manage duplicate files. Its efficiency stems from applying the Pigeonhole Principle and using a 3-level hashing strategy to minimize unnecessary file reads.

---

## ‚ú® Features

PigeonFinder goes beyond simple file comparison by offering intelligent filtering and safe file management options:

- **3-Level Pigeonhole Check for Speed:**
  - **Level 1 (Size):** Groups files by size first (the primary "pigeonhole"). Files with different sizes are immediately ignored.
  - **Level 2 (Partial Hash):** Compares the hash of the first 4KB of content for potential duplicates.
  - **Level 3 (Full Hash):** Only files that pass the first two quick checks undergo the final, costly full SHA-256 hash validation.

- **Actionable Management:** Supports deletion (`--delete`) or moving (`--move`) of duplicate files.
- **Intelligent Keep Mode:** Automatically selects the file to keep (the "original") based on your chosen criteria: newest, oldest, or shortest path.
- **Filtering:** Filter scans by file extension (`--ext`) and minimum size (`--min-size`).
- **Zero-Byte Handling:** Option to include or exclude zero-byte files (which always register as duplicates).
- **Detailed Reporting:** Generates a comprehensive report to the console and/or an output file (`--output`).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

PigeonFinder is written in Python and uses only standard libraries, making installation straightforward.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PigeonFinder.git
    cd PigeonFinder
    ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    # .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows PowerShell
    ```

3. **Run the CLI:**

    Execute the main script directly. Since all files are modularized, ensure you run the command from the root directory of the project.

## üöÄ Usage

The program is run using:

```bash
python cli_main.py <TARGET_DIRECTORY> [OPTIONS]
````

### Argument Reference

| Flag                  | Category   | Description                                                                                        | Example                    |
| --------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `path` (Required)     | Target     | The root directory path to recursively scan for duplicates.                                        | `./MyPhotos`               |
| `--ext`               | Filtering  | Comma-separated list of extensions to include (e.g., jpg,png).                                     | `--ext mp4,mov`            |
| `--min-size`          | Filtering  | Minimum file size (in bytes) to scan. Excludes smaller files.                                      | `--min-size 1024`          |
| `--include-zero-byte` | Filtering  | Include zero-byte files in scan and report as duplicates.                                          | `--include-zero-byte`      |
| `--delete`            | Action     | Deletes all duplicates found, keeping the file selected by `--keep-mode`.                          | `--delete`                 |
| `--move`              | Action     | Moves all duplicates found to the path specified by `--move-path`.                                 | `--move`                   |
| `--move-path`         | Action     | Destination directory for duplicates when using `--move`.                                          | `--move-path ./RecycleBin` |
| `--keep-mode`         | Keep Logic | Determines the "original" to keep: `newest` (default), `oldest`, or `path_length` (shortest path). | `--keep-mode oldest`       |
| `--output`            | Reporting  | Saves the final console report to the specified file.                                              | `--output scan_log.txt`    |

### Usage Examples

* **Find Duplicates, Keep Newest (Default):**

  ```bash
  python cli_main.py /data/projects/backup
  ```

* **Move Duplicates, Filter by Size/Extension, Keep Oldest:**

  ```bash
  python cli_main.py /home/user/downloads --move --move-path /tmp/duplicates --ext mp4,avi --min-size 5000000 --keep-mode oldest
  ```

## üèóÔ∏è Modular Architecture (For Developers)

The project is modularized based on the distinct responsibilities of the development team, ensuring clean separation of concerns:

| File Name        | Responsible Team Member        | Core Responsibility                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `core_engine.py` | Member 1 (Core Logic)          | Implements hashing algorithms (`get_full_hash`, `get_partial_hash`) and the 3-level Pigeonhole filtering logic (`find_duplicates`). Core engine.      |
| `file_io.py`     | Member 2 (I/O)                 | Manages disk interaction: file traversal (`scan_files`), file metadata retrieval, and destructive actions (`process_action`, `select_original_file`). |
| `cli_main.py`    | Members 4 & 5 (UI/Integration) | Handles CLI arguments (`argparse`), integrates logic from `core_engine.py` and `file_io.py`, and generates final user reports.                        |
